## Roadmap

# ROADMAP

Use this as a short, editable delivery plan.

- [ ] M1: Stabilize entry auth flow (decide and enforce auto-guest vs explicit login/guest choice).
- [ ] M1: Make Firestore the single high-score source and remove local score divergence.
- [ ] M1: Fix login setup issues (logo asset path and Google OAuth client ID).
- [ ] M2: Clarify leaderboard semantics (best score vs latest score per user).
- [ ] M2: Harden profile display (difficulty labels, ordering, empty/error states).
- [ ] M2: Apply `AuthGuard` strategy consistently to protected routes.
- [ ] M3: Implement a second quiz category (Logo or Capitals) using current category-key pattern.
- [ ] M3: Enable quiz-type switching in navigation/results flow.
- [ ] M4: Replace template widget test with app-specific flow tests.
- [ ] M4: Regenerate README from docs (`FEATURES`, `ROADMAP`, `ARCHITECTURE`).
